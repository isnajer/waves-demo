# WAVES - Sound Therapy On-Demand

For many, wellness services are unaffordable, inaccessible, and require advanced planning.
WAVESâ€™s mission is to expand access to free holistic wellness services and connect people directly to at-home and in-person wellness practices.
WAVES is designed to embed wellbeing into your daily routine, customized to your goals.
Users have on-demand access to a variety of brainwave targetted sound freuencies, the ability to book sound therapy sessions in advance, and 
personalized charts to track their progress over time.
